# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an AI Engineer bootcamp repository focused on a 6-month intensive program covering LLMs and AI agents. The repository appears to be in its early stages, containing primarily documentation and planning materials.

## Repository Structure

The repository currently contains:
- `README.md` - Comprehensive 24-week bootcamp curriculum covering AI engineering topics
- `.claude/agents/` - Contains specialized agent configuration files for different AI/ML domains:
  - `ai-agent-builder.md` - Agent building expertise
  - `fine-tuning-specialist.md` - Model fine-tuning guidance  
  - `mlops-engineer.md` - MLOps and deployment expertise
  - `nlp-transformer-expert.md` - Transformer architecture expertise
  - `python-pro.md` - Advanced Python development
  - `rag-architect.md` - Retrieval-Augmented Generation expertise

## Development Context

This repository serves as a learning and project workspace for an AI engineering bootcamp. The curriculum covers:

**Weeks 1-8**: Foundational topics (math, NLP, transformers, fine-tuning)
**Weeks 9-14**: Advanced applications (agents, RAG systems)  
**Weeks 15-20**: Infrastructure and deployment (training, inference, MLOps)
**Weeks 21-24**: Portfolio development and specialization

## Key Technologies Expected

Based on the curriculum, expect to work with:
- **ML/AI**: PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, LangChain
- **Vector DBs**: FAISS, Chroma
- **Deployment**: FastAPI, Docker, vLLM
- **MLOps**: MLflow, Gradio, Hugging Face Spaces

## Project Development Notes

- This appears to be a fresh repository for bootcamp work
- No existing build/test/lint commands are currently configured
- Projects will likely be added week by week following the curriculum schedule
- Each week may involve different technology stacks based on the learning objectives

## Current State

The repository is in setup phase with no active code projects yet. Future Claude Code instances should expect to help implement the various projects outlined in the weekly curriculum as the bootcamp progresses.
